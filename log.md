Development log for dyunus2-kritim2-rachelh8
## Development Log: 3/25/2022-4/1/2022
*What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not*
This week, our goal was to go through the data set/tech stack needed for the project and analyze it for the most crucial and relevant information in terms of our technical goals. We were able to accomplish this goal as we went through all the data in our csv files and successfully recognize the most crucial information. We realized that we will need to process the starting node IDs within our edge data in order to properly create the struct for our edges and nodes, which was the main takeaway from this week. While doing so, we also researched independently on the different technologies and algorithms that we would need. 

*What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week*
Diya - Used the Pandas library to check for missing and inconsistent values
Kriti - Learned and shared knowledge about the Pandas python library. Debugged anaconda issues.
Rachel - Researched about the different graph algorithms (Dijkstra's and PageRank algorithm) that we will use in our program

*What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals*
Some problems we encountered were that we needed to understand the steps of our project in order to figure out which data is needed. Since we had minimal experience with this, we had some trouble downloading and starting up an anaconda vm and using python libraries to clean our data. 

*What you plan to accomplish next week*
 Next week, we plan to begin the actual processing of our data by cleaning up any garbage values/outliers and irrelevant data. We will also try and determine the most efficient way to organize the algorithms we studied this week so that they are more time + storage efficient. While doing so, we may begin to explore potential ways to visualize our data as an actual graph (including external libraries/modules if necessary).
