# teamturtlesunite Team Contract
Final Project for dyunus2-kritim2-rachelh8
## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet weekly on Mondays from 7-9 pm on Zoom or in person, depending on each members' availability. Each week, one member will be responsible for noting down meeting minutes (rotate alphabetically) and add to the development log for that week. If we complete our work early or feel that we can work on our individual tasks independently, meetings may end early or be postponed.
2. **Assistance** We have an existing group chat setup over Messages, but can also use Discord or other forms of social media if necessary. Group members should be expected to respond within 24-48 hours, barring any personal emergencies or prior notice. 
3. **Respect** Being that we have an odd number of group members, we will thoroughly discuss any conflicting ideas and take a vote, following the majority decision. By signing this contract, each member is expected to listen to and engage with all other group members, as well as agreeing to the group decisions made. The notetaker for each weekly meeting will also be in charge of ensuring all members are able to contribute to our discussion.

## Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** At each of our weekly meetings, we will discuss the weekly deliverables for the entire group, at which point each member should volunteer for at least one task. If there are no volunteers for one deliverable, we will use an online wheel to randomly select one member to be assigned to that task. If there are unexpected complications or unforeseen work, we will discuss these situations as a group and decide how to redistribute our work or adjust the weekly deliverables.
2. **Time Commitment** Each group member should expect to contribute between 2-5 hours of work a week. If this is not the case, we will have a group discussion on how to redistribute the workload. Furthermore, if any member has more outside responsibilities in a given week, they can communicate that to the group to take on a slightly easier workload in exchange for a larger share of the work later on.
3. **Conflict Resolution** If a team member is repeatedly not completing their work or missing group meetings, we will discuss the situation and any personal circumstances affecting their productivity. Depending on the situation, we may also contact course staff to ensure they are well-informed. Although each member is assigned to individual tasks, we will work together as a group to complete the weekly deliverables decided on at the beginning of the week. If there are disagreements between members, we will ultimately go based on the majority decision/hold a group discussion on the best course of action. If we are still unable to come to a group conclusion, we will use an online wheel generator to make the decision.
