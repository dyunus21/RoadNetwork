### Comments
There are major flaws in Leading Question and Algorithms. Minor flaw in Algorithms.

**Leading Question**
The leading question mentions "central location" but does not clarify what is meant by the term. The graph datastructure and the algorithm to solve are also not clear. Please resubmit!

**Dataset**
The dataset is well described and the intuition on the efficiency of runtime and storage are good (although we will see alternatives which are better in some contexts). 

**Algorithm**
How is the graph to be built? The pagerank algorithm works on directed edges, how do you plan to use the road dataset for the purpose? It is not clear how the centrality will be achieved. Finally, the complexity mentioned for dijkstra is achieved with Fibonacci heap. You may want to estimate an achievable complexity.
