### Comments
Well written proposal with details.

**Leading Question**
Leading question is clear. 

**Dataset**
The dataset is well described and the intuition on the efficiency of runtime and storage are good (although we will see alternatives which are better in some contexts). 

**Algorithm**
While the algorithms are clearly specified, the format is a bit difficult to read. Too much detail included in Function inputs, meshing all 3 algorithms together, a better strategy would be describing for the 3 algorithms separately.
